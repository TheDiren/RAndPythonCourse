    "  \n",
    "Installation on Windows and Mac\n",

    "2. Install the free RStudio Desktop Version: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Do you know how you can install new R packages? You can read about it here: [ https://thedatacommunity.org/2017/09/17/installing-loading-unloading-and-removing-r-packages-in-rstudio/](https://thedatacommunity.org/2017/09/17/installing-loading-unloading-and-removing-r-packages-in-rstudio/ )\n",

    "\n",
    "In this script, we make use of following packages: reshape, ggplot2, lubridate, magrittr, car\n",

    "```{r eval=FALSE}\n",
    "install.packages(c(\"reshape\", \"ggplot2\", \"lubridate\", \"magrittr\", \"car\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Very many integrated development environment (IDE) software programs exist for Python. For this beginners course, we recommend the free and open source Python IDE called [Thonny](https://thonny.org/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Python:  \n",
    "[Thonny](https://thonny.org/) is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Just download the suitable executable installation file for your computer and start the installation. The basic set up of Python is done. When you open [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) for the first time, you will see the default set up of windows with a *code editor* on the upper left side, a *shell* on the lower left side and an *assistant* on the right hand side:\n",
    "![Thonny default set up](images/thonny_default_setup.png){width=800}\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Install additional Python packages:  \n",
    "During our course, we will use several additional packages. All can be installed **either** via the package installer PIP.  \n",
    "Example: Write the following code in the shell to install PANGAEApy.  \n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "!pip install pangaeapy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Or** click in the upper left hand corner of [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) on *Tools* and select *Manage packages …*. Search *jupyter* on PyPI and click on the *jupyter* search result to start the installation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The following packages are needed for this course:  \n",

    "For R, we recommend RStudio.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a new project\n",
    "\n",
    "In many statistics classes they teach you, that you should set a working directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r eval=F}\n",
    "setwd(\"~/Documents/\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be helpful to create a project instead. All files within the project's directory will automatically have the correct working directory. In this way you can create new files and start coding easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click File -> New Project...\n",
    "  Even when you choose \"Existing Directory\" you will still be able to create a new directory\n",
    "![Creating a Project, Step 1](images/project1.png)\n",
    "2. Enter the diretory path straight away, or click on browse.\n",
    "![Creating a Project, Step 2](images/project2.png)\n",
    "3. Choose an existing directory or create a new one\n",
    "![Creating a Project, Step 3](images/project3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RStudio screen\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the upper left hand corner you have the code editor. This is where you can type your scripts.\n",
    "- In the bottom left hand corner you have the console. Here you will see the results of all commands you are running.\n",
    "- In the upper right hand corner you can see all objects you created, e.g. data frames, functions, strings, ...\n",
    "- In the bottom left hand corner you will be able to see the files in your project, your plots and more information e.g. about functions\n",
    "![RStudio screen](images/rstudio.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use \"Ctrl\" followed by a number to jump to a specific window. If you want to get into the terminal use \"Shift+Alt+t\" or \"Shift+Alt+m\". You can find an overview of all short cuts using \"Shift+Alt+k\".\n",
    "![RStudio screen](images/rstudioNumbers.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### R Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "- You type your scripts in the code editor, so that you can save them.\n",
    "- If you want to run the whole script, you can click on 'Source' at the tope of the code editor or press \"Ctrl + Alt + R\". (Shortcuts might differ depending on your system.)\n",
    "- Use \"Ctrl + Alt + B/E\" to run from the beginning to the current line or from the current line to the end.\n",
    "- If you want to run a single line, you can click on 'Run' or press \"Control + Enter\"\n",
    "- If you want to run a few lines, highlight the lines you want to run and use 'Run'/  \"Control + Enter\"\n",
    "- If you want to use Autocomplete, you can press \"Control + Space\"\n",
    "- If you want to read about an existing method, you can type \"?\\<Name of the method\\>\" to get to the documentation\n",

    "#### Save your code in a script or notebook\n",
    "Python code is saved **either** in scripts with *.py* ending **or** in so called [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html)s with *.ipynb* ending. There is no difference in the python code itself only in the way the code is executed.   \n",
    "\n",
    "- Files with **.py** ending need to be executed in a *shell* or *terminal*, somewhere you type the command to execute your script. If you want to know more about the differences between a shell and a terminal, have a look at [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/difference-between-terminal-console-shell-and-command-line/).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Files with **.ipynb** ending consist of individual cells which can be executed directly in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Note: If you open a Jupyter Notebook in an editor, you will see that the python code is mixed with additional code to interprete each notebook cell. You can convert *.py* files to *.ipynb* files an vice versa using a command line tool in the *shell* as described in the [nbconvert documentation](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#convert-script).\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will work with [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html). To open a *Jupyter environment* write in the *shell* window of [Thonny](https://thonny.org/):  \n",
